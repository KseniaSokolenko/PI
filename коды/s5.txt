Five hundred pounds a year and her own room are the main things a woman needs for creativity, according
to Virginia Woolf. "My Own Room" is a famous essay based on lectures that Wolfe gave at Newnham College and
Girton College –two women's colleges at the University of Cambridge –in October 1928. In it, she addresses
all women involved in literature and recalls her great predecessors – Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte,
George Eliot – who were forced to write in a common living room, hide manuscripts away from prying eyes and
all the time face the opinion that writing is an unworthy occupation for a woman. The essay, despite its
journalistic format, does not lose the beauty and accuracy of the style inherent in the work of Virginia Woolf,
and is full of subtle humor and self-irony.
